### Tasks

- What needs to be returned by read and write file operations for a character device?

In gerneral, read and write for a character device have the following format.

```c
 ssize_t read(struct file *filp, char *buff, size_t count, loff_t *offp);
 ssize_t write(struct file *filp, const char *buff, size_t count, loff_t *offp);
```

where `filp` is the file pointer and `count` is the size of the requested data transfer. The `buff` argument points to the user buffer holding the data to be written or the empty buffer where the newly read data should be placed.  The return value is a ```signed size type```.

Both the *read* and *write* methods return a negative value if an error occurs. A return value greater than or equal to 0 tells the calling program how many bytes have been successfully transferred. If some data is transferred correctly and then an error happens, the return value must be the count of bytes successfully transferred, and the error does not get reported until the next time the function is called.

Although kernel functions return a negative number to signal an error, and the value of the number indicates the kind of error that occurred, programs that run in user space always see -1 as the error return value. They need to access the `errno` variable to find out what happened. The difference in behavior is dictated by the POSIX calling standard for system calls and the advantage of not dealing with `errno` in the kernel.

- How are exactly those major and minor numbers working? You vaguely remember that you can
  display them using ls ```-l /dev```

By using ```ls -l /dev```, we have the following result

From above, we notice that there are two numbers with the form as ```[xx, yy]```, where ```xx``` denotes the major number and  ```yy```  denotes the minor number for the device. 

The major number identifies the driver associated with the device. For example, `/dev/vcs1` and `/dev/vcs2` are both managed by driver 7, similarly, both ```vga_arbiter``` and `vhci` devices are managed by driver 10. The kernel uses the major number at *open* time to dispatch execution to the appropriate driver.

The minor number is used only by the driver specified by the major number; other parts of the kernel donâ€™t use it, and merely pass it along to the driver. It is common for a driver to control several devices (as shown in the listing); the minor number provides a way for the driver to differentiate among them.

- Knowing the major number and minor numbers of a device, how to add a character device to /dev?

First we have to had a char device driver with following file options

```c
struct file_operations fun{  
.open=open_fun,  
.release=release_fun,  
.write=write_fun,  
.read=read_fun,  
};  
```

- Then, include the header file **linux/device.h** and **linux/kdev_t.h**
  - Add static struct class c_dev;
  - Add static struct dev_t dev;

- Add the below API 's inside __init fuction of the driver
  - ```cl = class_create(THIS_MODULE ,"x")``` where x - Name to be displayed inside /sys/class/ when driver is loaded.
  - Use device_create () kernel api with ```device_create(cl, NULL, dev, NULL, "d")``` where device file to be created under ```/dev```.
