# Overview
#

Goals: 
- access lemonDB files and run queries without accessing the software
- extend UNIX "everything is a file" philosophy: a query is a file

Characteristics of lemonDBfs:
- usage: lemondbfs db_dir mount_dir

- strategy:
  1. for each .tbl file show a dir in mount_dir
     eg. for file mTable10.tbl show dir mTable10

  2. inside each dir show the corresponding table in file orig.tbl
     eg. for file mTable10.tbl show mtable10/orig.tbl
  
  3. inside each dir show an empty file called .query
     eg. for mTable10.tbl show the empty file mTable10/.query
  
  4. when a query is written to a .query file, apply it the orig.tbl
     and create the file res.tbl containing the result of the query
		 eg. upon a write on mTable10/.query run the query (error on wrong
		 query) and create mTable10/res.tbl with the result of the query


#
# Development
#

Getting started:
- prepare a skeleton of the code (eg. based on hello.c example?)
- add a simple printf to understand how/when the functions are called
  eg. printf("getattr(\"%s\"\n", path);
- keep the code short and simple, no long functions

# TODO
#

- lemonDBfs must be more stable (cf. BUGS)

- Allow more than one query in the .query file 

- When many queries are input allow temporary result tables to be 
  created. Use a mount flag? Take advantage of the DUMP query or use
  another approach?

- Allow the creation .tbl files: a dir in mount_dir + orig.tbl + 
  + .query file should create a corresponding .tbl file in db_dir

- Allow the deletion of .tbl files: when a dir is deleted in mount_dir
  the corresponding .tbl file should disappear

- Update this TODO. Creation + deletion are on the way, but not stable
  at all yet


#
# BUGS
#

!!DO NOT RUN AS ROOT!!

Could potentially corrupt the DB, or even crash lemonDB. New creation 
and deletion are very unstable and can have terrible consequences...
